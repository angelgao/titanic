# Titanic - Data Analysis
Using statistical analysis on a Titanic data set to predict which passengers survive.

To use python scripts, create a `csv` folder and provide the files `train.csv` and `test.csv` inside. These two datasets can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
